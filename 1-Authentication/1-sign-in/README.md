## Overview

This sample demonstrates a Vanilla JavaScript single-page application (SPA) that lets users sign-in to [Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis) (Azure AD) using the [Microsoft Authentication Library for JavaScript](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js) (MSAL.js). In doing so, it also illustrates various authentication concepts, such as [ID Tokens](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/id-tokens), [OIDC scopes](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-permissions-and-consent#openid-connect-scopes), [single-sign on](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-js-sso), **account selection**, **silent requests** and more.

## Scenario

1. The client application uses **MSAL.js** to sign-in a user and obtain an **ID Token** from **Azure AD**.
2. The **ID Token** proves that the user has successfully signed-in with their organization's tenant.

## Prerequisites

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) must be installed to run this sample.
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) is recommended for running and editing this sample.
* [VS Code Azure Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-node-azure-pack) extension is recommended for interacting with Azure through VS Code Interface.
* A modern web browser.
* An **Azure AD** tenant. For more information, see: [How to get an Azure AD tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/test-setup-environment#get-a-test-tenant)
* A user account in your **Azure AD** tenant.

>This sample will not work with a **personal Microsoft account**. If you're signed in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with a personal Microsoft account and have not created a user account in your directory before, you will need to create one before proceeding.

## Setup the sample

### Step 1: Clone or download this repository

From your shell or command line:

```console
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-javascript-tutorial.git
```

or download and extract the repository *.zip* file.

> :warning: To avoid path length limitations on Windows, we recommend cloning into a directory near the root of your drive.

### Step 2: Install project dependencies

```console
    cd 1-Authentication\1-sign-in
    npm install
```

### Step 3: Register the sample application(s) in your tenant

There is one project in this sample. To register it, you can:

* follow the steps below for manually register your apps
* or use PowerShell scripts that:
  * **automatically** creates the Azure AD applications and related objects (passwords, permissions, dependencies) for you.
  * modify the projects' configuration files.

  <details>
   <summary>Expand this section if you want to use this automation:</summary>

    > :warning: If you have never used **Microsoft Graph PowerShell** before, we recommend you go through the [App Creation Scripts Guide](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md) once to ensure that your environment is prepared correctly for this step.
  
    1. On Windows, run PowerShell as **Administrator** and navigate to the root of the cloned directory
    1. In PowerShell run:

       ```PowerShell
       Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process -Force
       ```

    1. Run the script to create your Azure AD application and configure the code of the sample application accordingly.
    1. For interactive process -in PowerShell, run:

       ```PowerShell
       cd .\AppCreationScripts\
       .\Configure.ps1 -TenantId "[Optional] - your tenant id" -AzureEnvironmentName "[Optional] - Azure environment, defaults to 'Global'"
       ```

    > Other ways of running the scripts are described in [App Creation Scripts guide](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md). The scripts also provide a guide to automated application registration, configuration and removal which can help in your CI/CD scenarios.

  </details>

#### Choose the Azure AD tenant where you want to create your applications

To manually register the apps, as a first step you'll need to:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. If your account is present in more than one Azure AD tenant, select your profile at the top right corner in the menu on top of the page, and then **switch directory** to change your portal session to the desired Azure AD tenant.

#### Register the client app (ms-identity-javascript-c1s1)

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Select the **App Registrations** blade on the left, then select **New registration**.
1. In the **Register an application page** that appears, enter your application's registration information:
    1. In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `ms-identity-javascript-c1s1`.
    1. Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in this organizational directory only**
    1. Select **Register** to create the application.
1. In the **Overview** blade, find and note the **Application (client) ID**. You use this value in your app's configuration file(s) later in your code.
1. In the app's registration screen, select the **Authentication** blade to the left.
1. If you don't have a platform added, select **Add a platform** and select the **Single-page application** option.
    1. In the **Redirect URI** section enter the following redirect URIs:
        1. `http://localhost:3000`
        1. `http://localhost:3000/redirect`
    1. Click **Save** to save your changes.

##### Configure Optional Claims

1. Still on the same app registration, select the **Token configuration** blade to the left.
1. Select **Add optional claim**:
    1. Select **optional claim type**, then choose **ID**.
    1. Select the optional claim **acct**.
    > Provides user's account status in tenant. If the user is a **member** of the tenant, the value is *0*. If they're a **guest**, the value is *1*.
    1. Select **Add** to save your changes.

##### Configure the client app (ms-identity-javascript-c1s1) to use your app registration

Open the project in your IDE (like Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code) to configure the code.

> In the steps below, "ClientID" is the same as "Application ID" or "AppId".

1. Open the `App\authConfig.js` file.
1. Find the key `Enter_the_Application_Id_Here` and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of `ms-identity-javascript-c1s1` app copied from the Azure portal.
1. Find the key `Enter_the_Tenant_Info_Here` and replace the existing value with your Azure AD tenant/directory ID.

### Step 4: Running the sample

```console
    cd 1-Authorization\1-sign-in
    npm start
```

## Explore the sample

1. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
1. Click the **sign-in** button on the top right corner.

## About the code

## Sign-in

MSAL.js provides 3 login APIs: `loginPopup()`, `loginRedirect()` and `ssoSilent()`:

```javascript
    myMSALObj.loginPopup(loginRequest)
        .then((response) => {
            // your logic
        })
        .catch(error => {
            console.error(error);
        });
```

To use the redirect flow, you must register a handler for redirect promise. **MSAL.js** provides`handleRedirectPromise()` API:

```javascript
    myMSALObj.handleRedirectPromise()
        .then((response) => {
            // your logic
        })
        .catch(err => {
            console.error(err);
        });

    myMSALObj.loginRedirect(loginRequest);
```

The recommended pattern is that you fallback to an **interactive method** should the silent SSO fails.

```javascript

    const silentRequest = {
      scopes: ["openid", "profile"],
      loginHint: "example@domain.net"
    };

    myMSALObj.ssoSilent(silentRequest)
        .then((response) => {
            // your logic
        }).catch(error => {
            console.error("Silent Error: " + error);
            if (error instanceof msal.InteractionRequiredAuthError) {
                myMSALObj.loginRedirect(loginRequest);
            }
        });
```

You can get all the active accounts of a user with the get `getAllAccounts()` API. If you know the **username** or **home ID** of an account, you can select it by:

```javascript
    myMSALObj.getAccountByUsername(username);
    // or
    myMSALObj.getAccountByHomeId(homeId);
```

### Sign-out

The Application redirects the user to the **Microsoft identity platform** logout endpoint to sign out. This endpoint clears the user's session from the browser. If your app did not go to the logout endpoint, the user may re-authenticate to your app without entering their credentials again, because they would have a valid single sign-in session with the **Microsoft identity platform** endpoint. For more, see: [Send a sign-out request](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-protocols-oidc#send-a-sign-out-request)

### ID Token Validation

A single-page application does not benefit from validating ID tokens, since the application runs without a back-end and as such, attackers can intercept and edit the keys used for validation of the token.

### Sign-in Audience and Account Types

This sample is meant to work with accounts in your organization (aka *single-tenant*). If you would like to allow sign-ins with other type accounts, you have to configure your `authority` string in `authConfig.js` accordingly. For example:

```javascript
const msalConfig = {
    auth: {
      clientId: "<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>",
      authority: "https://login.microsoftonline.com/consumers", // allows sign-ins with personal Microsoft accounts.
      redirectUri: "<YOUR_REDIRECT_URI>",
    },
```

For more information about audiences and account types, please see: [Validation differences by supported account types (signInAudience)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/supported-accounts-validation)

> :warning: Be aware that making an application multi-tenant entails more than just modifying the `authority` string. For more information, please see [How to: Sign in any Azure Active Directory user using the multi-tenant application pattern](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-convert-app-to-be-multi-tenant).

### Authentication in National Clouds

National clouds (aka Sovereign clouds) are physically isolated instances of Azure. These regions of Azure are designed to make sure that data residency, sovereignty, and compliance requirements are honored within geographical boundaries. Enabling your application for sovereign clouds requires you to:

* register your application in a specific portal, depending on the cloud.
* use a specific authority, depending on the cloud in the configuration file for your application.
* in case you want to call the MS Graph, this requires a specific Graph endpoint URL, depending on the cloud.

For instance, to configure this sample for **Azure AD Germany** national cloud:

1. Open the `App\authConfig.js` file.
1. Find the key `Enter_the_Application_Id_Here` and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of the `ms-identity-javascript-tutorial-c1s1` application copied from the Azure portal.
1. Find the key `Enter_the_Cloud_Instance_Id_Here/Enter_the_Tenant_Info_Here` and replace the existing value with `https://portal.microsoftazure.de/<your-tenant-id>`.
1. Find the key `Enter_the_Redirect_Uri_Here` and replace the existing value with the base address of the `ms-identity-javascript-tutorial-c1s1` application (by default `http://localhost:3000`).

See [National Clouds](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/authentication-national-cloud#app-registration-endpoints) for more information.
