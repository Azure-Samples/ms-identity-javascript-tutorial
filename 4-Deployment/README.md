## Overview

This sample demonstrates how to deploy a JavaScript single-page application (SPA) coupled with a Node.js web API to **Azure Cloud** using [Azure Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/) and [Azure App Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/), respectively. To do so, we will use the [same code sample from Chapter 3](../3-Authorization-II/1-call-api).

## Scenario

1. The client application uses the **MSAL.js** library to sign-in a user and obtain a JWT **Access Token** from **Azure AD**.
1. The **Access Token** is used as a **bearer** token to *authorize* the user to call the protected web API.
1. The protected web API responds with the claims in the **Access Token**.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) must be installed to run this sample.
- A modern web browser. This sample uses **ES6** conventions and will not run on **Internet Explorer**.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) is recommended for running and editing this sample.
- [VS Code Azure Tools Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-node-azure-pack) extension is recommended for interacting with **Azure** through VS Code interface.
- An **Azure AD** tenant. For more information, see: [How to get an Azure AD tenant](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/active-directory-howto-tenant/)
- A user account in your **Azure AD** tenant.
- An **Azure subscription**. This sample uses **Azure Storage** and **Azure App Service**.

## Setup

- Setup the service app:

```console
    cd ms-identity-javascript-tutorial
    cd 3-Authorization-II/1-call-api
    cd API
    npm install
```

- Setup the client app:

```console
    cd ..
    cd SPA
    npm install
```

## Registration

### Register the service app (Node.js web API)

Use the same app registration credentials that you've obtained during [**chapter 3-1**](../3-Authorization-II/1-call-api).

### Register the client app (JavaScript SPA)

Use the same app registration credentials that you've obtained during [**chapter 3-1**](../3-Authorization-II/1-call-api).

## Deployment

There are basically **3** stages that you will have to go through in order to deploy your projects and enable authentication:

1. Upload your project files to **Azure** services and obtain published website URIs
1. Update **Azure AD** **App Registration** with URIs you have just obtained
1. Update your configuration files with URIs you have just obtained

### Deploy the service app (Node.js web API)

There are various ways to deploy your applications to **Azure App Service**. Here we provide steps for deployment via **VS Code Azure Tools Extension**. For more alternatives, visit: [Static website hosting in Azure Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-static-website#uploading-content).

> We recommend watching the [video tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/developer/javascript/tutorial-vscode-azure-app-service-node-01) offered by Microsoft Docs for preparation.

#### Step 1: Deploy your app

1. In the **VS Code** activity bar, select the **Azure** logo to show the **AZURE APP SERVICE** explorer. Select **Sign in to Azure...** and follow the instructions. Once signed in, the explorer should show the name of your **Azure** subscription(s).

![api_step1](./ReadmeFiles/api_step1.png)

2. On the **App Service** explorer section you will see an upward-facing arrow icon. Click on it publish your local files in the `API` folder to **Azure App Services**.

![api_step2](./ReadmeFiles/api_step2.png)

3. Choose a creation option based on the operating system to which you want to deploy. in this sample, we choose **Linux**.
4. Select a Node.js version when prompted. An **LTS** version is recommended.
5. Type a globally unique name for your web app and press Enter. The name must be unique across all of **Azure**.
6. After you respond to all the prompts, **VS Code** shows the **Azure** resources that are being created for your app in its notification popup.
7. Select **Yes** when prompted to update your configuration to run npm install on the target Linux server.

![api_step3](./ReadmeFiles/api_step3.png)

#### Step 2: Disable default authentication

Now you need to navigate to the **Azure App Service** Portal, and locate your project there. Once you do, click on the **Authentication/Authorization** blade. There, make sure that the **App Services Authentication** is switched off (and nothing else is checked), as we are using **our own** authentication logic.

#### Step 3: Enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)

### Deploy the client app (JavaScript SPA)

There are various ways to deploy your applications to **Azure Storage**. Here we provide steps for deployment via **VS Code Azure Tools Extension**. For more alternatives, visit: [Static website hosting in Azure Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-static-website#uploading-content).

> We recommend watching the [video tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/developer/javascript/tutorial-vscode-static-website-node-01) offered by Microsoft Docs for preparation.

#### Step 1: Deploy the app

Create a distributable files folder, where your `html`, `css` and `javascript` files will be located (in the sample, the `SPA/App/` folder is already usable for this). Then follow the steps below:

1. Right click on the `SPA/App/` folder inside. This will open a context menu where you will see the option **Deploy to static website via Azure Storage**. Click on it.

![spa_step1](./ReadmeFiles/spa_step1.png)

2. Follow the dialog window that opens on the top. Select your subscription, then give a name to your storage account.

![spa_step2](./ReadmeFiles/spa_step2.png)

3. Once your storage account is created and your files are uploaded, you will see a notification on the bottom-right corner of VS Code interface. When it's done, you will be notified with the published URI of your static website (e.g. `https://javascriptspa1.z22.web.core.windows.net/`).

![spa_step3](./ReadmeFiles/spa_step3.png)

#### Step 2: Update the client app's authentication parameters

1. Navigate back to to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. In the left-hand navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service, and then select **App registrations**.
1. In the resulting screen, select the name of your application.
1. From the *Branding* menu, update the **Home page URL**, to the address of your service, for example [https://javascriptspa1.z22.web.core.windows.net/](https://javascriptspa1.z22.web.core.windows.net/). Save the configuration.
1. Add the same URI in the list of values of the *Authentication -> Redirect URIs* menu. If you have multiple redirect URIs, make sure that there a new entry using the App service's URI for each redirect URI.

#### Step 3: Update the client app's configuration files

Now you need to update your authentication configuration files in the client project. To do so, go to your **Azure Storage Account** explorer via **VS Code** Azure panel. There, click on your project's name > Blob Container > Web as shown below:

![spa_step4](./ReadmeFiles/spa_step4.png)

Open `authConfig.js`. Then:

1. Find the key `msalConfig.auth.redirectUri` and replace the existing value with your static webpage's URI that you have just registered e.g. `https://javascriptspa1.z22.web.core.windows.net/`
1. Find the key `apiConfig.uri` and replace the existing value with your published web API's endpoint, e.g. `https://node-webapi-1.azurewebsites.net/api`

## Explore the sample

1. Open your browser and navigate to your deployed client app's URI, for instance: `https://javascriptspa1.z22.web.core.windows.net/`.
1. Click the **sign-in** button on the top right corner.
1. Once you authenticate, click the **Call API** button at the center.
