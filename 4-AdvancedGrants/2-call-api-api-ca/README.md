## Overview

This sample demonstrates how a JavaScript single-page application (SPA) calling a middle-tier Node.js web API which in turn calls another Node.js web API *down the stream* handles the [claims challenge](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-error-handling-js#conditional-access-and-claims-challenges) generated by downstream APIs, using an [Access Token](https://aka.ms/access-tokens) obtained via [OAuth 2.0 on-behalf-of flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-on-behalf-of-flow). The downstream web API has a [conditional access](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/overview) policy that enables [multi-factor authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/authentication/tutorial-enable-azure-mfa) (MFA). Thus, the [Access Token](https://aka.ms/access-tokens) for the downstream web API will only be issued by Azure AD if the signed-in user has performed **MFA**. However, since the downstream web API has no user interaction capability, the [claims challenge](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-error-handling-js#conditional-access-and-claims-challenges) generated by the conditional access policy needs to be *propagated back* to the client app (SPA) via the middle-tier web API, which then can take the user back to Azure AD to get the **MFA** done.

## Scenario

1. The client app uses the **MSAL.js** to sign-in a user and obtain a **JWT** [Access Token](https://aka.ms/access-tokens) from **Azure AD** for the middle-tier web API.
1. The access token is used as a *bearer token* to authorize the user to call the **middle-tier web API** protected by the **Microsoft identity platform**.
1. The **middle-tier web API** uses the access token sent from the client app to **Azure AD** to receive a new access token using the [on-behalf-of flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-on-behalf-of-flow) for the downstream web API. If the user hasn't satisfied the MFA, Azure AD generates a **claims challenge** and sends the challenge back to the **middle-tier web API**.
1. The **middle-tier web API** propagates the **claims challenge** back to client app, which then initiates an **interactive** token request again with the Microsoft identity platform to get the user to perform MFA as well.
1. Once the user successfully conducts MFA, a new access token for is provided to client app for the **middle-tier web API**.
1. Steps **2** and **3** are repeated, and this time the call to **downstream web API** succeeds.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) must be installed to run this sample.
- A modern web browser. This sample uses **ES6** conventions and will not run on **Internet Explorer**.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) is recommended for running and editing this sample.
- An **Azure AD** tenant with [Conditional Access](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/overview#license-requirements) available. For more information see: [How to get an Azure AD tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-create-new-tenant)
- A user account in your **Azure AD** tenant. This sample will not work with a **personal Microsoft account**. Therefore, if you signed in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with a personal account and have never created a user account in your directory before, you need to do that now.
- Make sure that the user account you want to use for this is [enabled for MFA]((https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/user-help/user-help-auth-app-add-work-school-account)).

## Setup

### Step 1: Clone or download this repository

From your shell or command line:

```console
    git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-javascript-tutorial.git
```

or download and extract the repository .zip file.

> :warning: To avoid path length limitations on Windows, we recommend cloning into a directory near the root of your drive.

### Step 2: Install project dependencies

Locate the project root folder (`4-AdvancedGrants\2-call-api-api-ca`) in a command prompt. Then:

```console
    cd DownstreamAPI
    npm install
```

```console
    cd ..
    cd MiddletierAPI
    npm install
```

```console
    cd ..
    cd SPA
    npm install
```

## Registration

### Register the sample application(s) with your Azure Active Directory tenant

There are three projects in this sample. Each needs to be separately registered in your Azure AD tenant. To register these projects, you can:

- follow the steps below for manually register your apps
- or use PowerShell scripts that:
  - **automatically** creates the Azure AD applications and related objects (passwords, permissions, dependencies) for you.
  - modify the projects' configuration files.

<details>
  <summary>Expand this section if you want to use this automation:</summary>

> :warning: If you have never used **Azure AD Powershell** before, we recommend you go through the [App Creation Scripts](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md) once to ensure that your environment is prepared correctly for this step.

1. On Windows, run PowerShell as **Administrator** and navigate to the root of the cloned directory
1. If you have never used Azure AD Powershell before, we recommend you go through the [App Creation Scripts](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md) once to ensure that your environment is prepared correctly for this step.
1. In PowerShell run:

   ```PowerShell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process -Force
   ```

1. Run the script to create your Azure AD application and configure the code of the sample application accordingly.
1. In PowerShell run:

   ```PowerShell
   cd .\AppCreationScripts\
   .\Configure.ps1
   ```

   > Other ways of running the scripts are described in [App Creation Scripts](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md)
   > The scripts also provide a guide to automated application registration, configuration and removal which can help in your CI/CD scenarios.

</details>

### Choose the Azure AD tenant where you want to create your applications

As a first step you'll need to:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. If your account is present in more than one Azure AD tenant, select your profile at the top right corner in the menu on top of the page, and then **switch directory** to change your portal session to the desired Azure AD tenant.

### Register the downstream web API (ms-identity-javascript-tutorial-c4s2-downstream)

1. Select the **App Registrations** blade on the left, then select **New registration**.
1. In the **Register an application page** that appears, enter your application's registration information:
   - In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `ms-identity-javascript-tutorial-c4s2-downstream`.
   - Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in this organizational directory only**.
1. Select **Register** to create the application.
1. In the app's registration screen, find and note the **Application (client) ID**. You use this value in your app's configuration file(s) later in your code.
1. Select **Save** to save your changes.
1. In the app's registration screen, select the **Expose an API** blade to the left to open the page where you can declare the parameters to expose this app as an API for which client applications can obtain [access tokens](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens) for.
The first thing that we need to do is to declare the unique [resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow) URI that the clients will be using to obtain access tokens for this API. To declare an resource URI, follow the following steps:
   - Select `Set` next to the **Application ID URI** to generate a URI that is unique for this app.
   - For this sample, accept the proposed Application ID URI (`api://{clientId}`) by selecting **Save**.
1. All APIs have to publish a minimum of one [scope](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow#request-an-authorization-code) for the client's to obtain an access token successfully. To publish a scope, follow the following steps:
   - Select **Add a scope** button open the **Add a scope** screen and Enter the values as indicated below:
        - For **Scope name**, use `access_downstream_api_as_user`.
        - Select **Admins and users** options for **Who can consent?**.
        - For **Admin consent display name** type `Access ms-identity-javascript-tutorial-c4s2-downstream`.

## About the code

### Handling conditional access claims challenge

If the conditional access policy is not satisfied when calling the downstream web API, Azure AD will throw an error together with a claims challenge. In our middle-tier web API, we are to catch this and send it to the client SPA. This is illustrated in the middle-tier web API [index.js](./MiddletierAPI/index.js) file:

```javascript
   try {
      // request new token and use it to call resource API on user's behalf
      tokenObj = await getNewAccessToken(userToken);

      // check for errors
      if (tokenObj['error_codes']) {
            
            /**
             * Conditional access MFA requirement throws an AADSTS50076 error.
             * If the user has not enrolled in MFA, an AADSTS50079 error will be thrown instead.
             * If the user has not consented to required scopes, an AADSTS65001 error will be thrown instead.
             * In either case, sample middle-tier API will propagate the error back to the client.
             * For more, visit: https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-conditional-access-dev-guide
             */
            if (tokenObj['error_codes'].includes(50076) || tokenObj['error_codes'].includes(50079) || tokenObj['error_codes'].includes(65001)) {
               return res.status(403).json(tokenObj);
            }
      }

      try {
            // access the resource with the token
            let apiResponse = await callResourceAPI(tokenObj['access_token'], config.resources.downstreamAPI.resourceUri);
            return res.status(200).json(apiResponse);
      } catch (error) {
            console.log(error);
            return res.status(403).json(error);
      }
      
   } catch (error) {
      console.log(error);
      return res.status(403).json(error);
   }
```

Then, in the SPA project, we catch this error response and initiate an interactive token request with additional claims. To do so, we append the JSON object from the response to our [tokenRequest](./SPA/App/authConfig.js) object before triggering the interactive token request. This is illustrated in [api.js](./SPA/App/api.js):

```javascript
   // check for any errors
   if (response['error_codes']) {

      /**
       * Conditional access MFA requirement generates AADSTS50076 error.
       * If this occurs, sample middle-tier API will propagate this to client
       * For more, visit: https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-conditional-access-dev-guide
       */
      if (response['error_codes'].includes(50076) || response['error_codes'].includes(50079)) {

          // attach the stringified JSON claims challenge to token request 
          tokenRequest.claims = response['claims'];
    
          // calls the MSAL.js acquireToken* API
          passTokenToApi();
      }
   } else {
      // if no errors, display user name
      logMessage('Web API responded: Hello ' + response['name'] + '!');
   }
```
