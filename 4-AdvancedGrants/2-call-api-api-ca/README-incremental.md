## Overview

This sample demonstrates how a JavaScript single-page application (SPA) calling a middle-tier Node.js web API which in turn calls another Node.js web API downstream, using an [Access Token](https://aka.ms/access-tokens) obtained via [OAuth 2.0 on-behalf-of flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-on-behalf-of-flow) handles [claims challenge](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-error-handling-js#conditional-access-and-claims-challenges) generated by downstream APIs. The downstream web API has a [conditional access](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/overview) policy that enables [multi-factor authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/authentication/tutorial-enable-azure-mfa) (MFA). Thus, the [Access Token](https://aka.ms/access-tokens) for the downstream web API will only be issued by Azure AD if the signed-in user has performed **MFA**. However, since the downstream web API has no user interaction capability, the [claims challenge](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/msal-error-handling-js#conditional-access-and-claims-challenges) generated by the conditional access policy needs to be *propagated back* to the client app (SPA) via the middle-tier web API, which then can take the user back to Azure AD to get the **MFA** done.

## Scenario

1. The client app uses the **MSAL.js** to sign-in a user and obtain a **JWT** [Access Token](https://aka.ms/access-tokens) from **Azure AD** for the middle-tier web API.
1. The access token is used as a *bearer token* to authorize the user to call the **middle-tier web API** protected by the **Microsoft identity platform**.
1. The **middle-tier web API** uses the access token sent from the client app to **Azure AD** to receive a new access token using the [on-behalf-of flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-on-behalf-of-flow) for the downstream web API.
1. The **middle-tier web API** uses this new access token to call the **downstream web API**.
1. The **Downstream web API** generates a **claims challenge** if the user hasn't satisfied the MFA and sends the challenge back to the **middle-tier web API**.
1. The **middle-tier web API** propagates the **claims challenge** back to client app, which then initiates an **interactive** token request again with the Microsoft identity platform to get the user to perform MFA as well.
1. Once the user successfully conducts MFA, a new access token for is provided to client app for the **middle-tier web API**.
1. Steps **3** and **4** are repeated, and this time the call to **downstream web API** succeeds.

## Setup

Locate the project root folder (`4-AdvancedGrants\2-call-api-api-ca`) in a command prompt. Then:

```console
    cd DownstreamAPI
    npm install
```

```console
    cd ..

## Registration

### Register the downstream service app (ms-identity-javascript-c4s2-downstream)

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select the **Azure AD** service.
1. Select the **App Registrations** blade on the left, then select **New registration**.
1. In the **Register an application page** that appears, enter your application's registration information:
   - In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `ms-identity-javascript-c4s2-downstream`.
   - Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in this organizational directory only**.
1. Select **Register** to create the application.
1. In the app's registration screen, find and note the **Application (client) ID**. You use this value in your app's configuration file(s) later in your code.
1. Select **Save** to save your changes.
1. In the app's registration screen, select the **Expose an API** blade to the left to open the page where you can declare the parameters to expose this app as an API for which client applications can obtain [access tokens](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens) for.
The first thing that we need to do is to declare the unique [resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow) URI that the clients will be using to obtain access tokens for this API. To declare an resource URI, follow the following steps:
   - Select `Set` next to the **Application ID URI** to generate a URI that is unique for this app.
   - For this sample, accept the proposed Application ID URI (`api://{clientId}`) by selecting **Save**.
1. All APIs have to publish a minimum of one [scope](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow#request-an-authorization-code) for the client's to obtain an access token successfully. To publish a scope, follow the following steps:
   - Select **Add a scope** button open the **Add a scope** screen and Enter the values as indicated below:
        - For **Scope name**, use `access_downstream_api_as_user`.
        - Select **Admins and users** options for **Who can consent?**.
        - For **Admin consent display name** type `Access ms-identity-javascript-c4s2-downstream`.
        - For **Admin consent description** type `Allows the app to access ms-identity-javascript-c4s2-downstream as the signed-in user.`
        - For **User consent display name** type `Access ms-identity-javascript-c4s2-downstream`.
        - For **User consent description** type `Allow the application to access ms-identity-javascript-c4s2-downstream on your behalf.`
        - Keep **State** as **Enabled**.
        - Select the **Add scope** button on the bottom to save this scope.
1. On the right side menu, select the `Manifest` blade.
   - Set `accessTokenAcceptedVersion` property to **2**.
   - Click on **Save**.

#### Configure the downstream service app (ms-identity-javascript-c4s2-downstream) to use your app registration

Open the project in your IDE (like Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code) to configure the code.

> In the steps below, "ClientID" is the same as "Application ID" or "AppId".

### Update the middle-tier service app registration (ms-identity-javascript-c3s1-api)

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select the **Azure AD** service.
1. Select the **App Registrations** blade on the left, then find and select the service app that you have registered in the previous tutorial (`ms-identity-javascript-c3s1-api`).
1. In the app's registration screen, select the **API permissions** blade in the left to open the page where we add access to the APIs that your application needs.
   - Select the **Add a permission** button and then,
   - Ensure that the **My APIs** tab is selected.
   - In the list of APIs, select the API `ms-identity-javascript-c4s2-downstream`.
   - In the **Delegated permissions** section, select the **access_downstream_api_as_user** in the list. Use the search box if necessary.
   - Select the **Add permissions** button at the bottom.

#### Configure the middle-tier service app (ms-identity-javascript-c3s1-api) to use your app registration

Open the project in your IDE (like Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code) to configure the code.

> In the steps below, "ClientID" is the same as "Application ID" or "AppId".

1. Open the `MiddletierAPI\config.json` file.
1. Find the key `clientID` and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of `ms-identity-javascript-c3s1-api` app copied from the Azure portal.
1. Find the key `tenantID` and replace the existing value with your Azure AD tenant ID.
1. Find the key `clientSecret` and replace the existing value with the key you saved during the creation of `ms-identity-javascript-c3s1-api` copied from the Azure portal.
1. Find the key `downstreamAPI.resourceScopes` and replace the existing value with the scope you have exposed during the registration of DownstreamAPI project e.g. `api://<DownstreamAPI_Application_Id>/access_downstream_api_as_user`.

## About the code

### Handling conditional access claims challenge

If the conditional access policy is not satisfied when calling the downstream web API, Azure AD will throw an error together with a claims challenge. In our middle-tier web API, we are to catch this error coming from the downstream web API, and send it to the client SPA. This is illustrated in the middle-tier web API [index.js](./MiddletierAPI/index.js) file:

```javascript
   try {
      // request new token and use it to call resource API on user's behalf
      let tokenObj = await getNewAccessToken(userToken);

      if (tokenObj['error_codes']) {
            
            /**
             * Conditional access MFA requirement generates AADSTS50076 error.
             * If this occurs, sample middle-tier API will propagate this to client
             * For more, visit: https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-conditional-access-dev-guide
             */

            if (tokenObj['error_codes'].includes(50076) || tokenObj['error_codes'].includes(50079)) {
               return res.status(401).json(tokenObj);
            }
      }

      // access the resource with the token
      let apiResponse = await callResourceAPI(tokenObj['access_token'], config.resources.downstreamAPI.resourceUri)
      res.status(200).json(apiResponse);
   } catch (error) {
      console.log(error)
      return res.status(500).json(error);
   }
```

Then, in the SPA project, we catch this error response and initiate an interactive token request with additional claims. To do so, we append the JSON object from the response to our [tokenRequest](./SPA/App/authConfig.js) object before triggering the interactive token request. This is illustrated in [api.js](./SPA/App/api.js):

```javascript
   // check for any errors
   if (response['error_codes']) {

      /**
       * Conditional access MFA requirement generates AADSTS50076 error.
       * If this occurs, sample middle-tier API will propagate this to client
       * For more, visit: https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-conditional-access-dev-guide
       */
      if (response['error_codes'].includes(50076) || response['error_codes'].includes(50079)) {

          // attach the stringified JSON claims challenge to token request 
          tokenRequest.claims = response['claims'];
    
          // calls the MSAL.js acquireToken* API
          passTokenToApi();
      }
   } else {
      // if no errors, display user name
      logMessage('Web API responded: Hello ' + response['name'] + '!');
   }
```
