## Overview

This sample demonstrates a Vanilla JavaScript single-page application that lets users authenticate against [Azure Active Directory B2C](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/active-directory/external-identities/b2c/) using the [Microsoft Authentication Library for JavaScript](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js) (MSAL.js), then acquires an **Access Token** for a web API that is also protected by **Azure AD B2C**. In doing so, it also illustrates various authorization and B2C concepts, such as [Access Tokens](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens), [Refresh Tokens](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/tokens-overview#token-types), [Token Lifetimes and Configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory-b2c/tokens-overview#configuration), **silent requests** and more.

## Scenario

1. The client application uses the **MSAL.js** to obtain an **Access Token** from **Azure AD B2C**.
1. The **Access Token** is used as a **bearer** to *authorize* the user to call a protected web API.
1. The protected web API responds with the claims in the **Access Token**.

## Registration

> :information_source: This sample comes with a pre-registered application for testing purposes. If you would like to use your own **Azure AD B2C** tenant and application, follow the steps below to register and configure the applications in the **Azure Portal**. Otherwise, continue with the steps for [Running the sample](#running-the-sample).

### Choose the Azure AD B2C tenant where you want to create your applications

As a first step you'll need to:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. If your account is present in more than one Azure AD B2C tenant, select your profile at the top right corner in the menu on top of the page, and then **switch directory** to change your portal session to the desired Azure AD B2C tenant.

### Register the service app

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select the **Azure AD B2C** service.
1. Select the **App Registrations** blade on the left, then select **New registration**.
1. In the **Register an application page** that appears, enter your application's registration information:
   - In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `ms-identity-javascript-tutorial-c3s2-api`.
   - Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in any organizational directory only**.
1. Select **Register** to create the application.
1. In the app's registration screen, find and note the **Application (client) ID**. You use this value in your app's configuration file(s) later in your code.
1. Select **Save** to save your changes.
1. In the app's registration screen, select the **Expose an API** blade to the left to open the page where you can declare the parameters to expose this app as an API for which client applications can obtain [access tokens](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens) for.
The first thing that we need to do is to declare the unique [resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow) URI that the clients will be using to obtain access tokens for this API. To declare an resource URI, follow the following steps:
   - Click `Set` next to the **Application ID URI** to generate a URI that is unique for this app.
   - For this sample, accept the proposed Application ID URI (api://{clientId}) by selecting **Save**.
1. All APIs have to publish a minimum of one [scope](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow#request-an-authorization-code) for the client's to obtain an access token successfully. To publish a scope, follow the following steps:
   - Select **Add a scope** button open the **Add a scope** screen and Enter the values as indicated below:
        - For **Scope name**, use `access_as_user`.
        - Select **Admins and users** options for **Who can consent?**
        - For **Admin consent display name** type `Access ms-identity-javascript-tutorial-c3s2-api`
        - For **Admin consent description** type `Allows the app to access ms-identity-javascript-tutorial-c3s2-api as the signed-in user.`
        - For **User consent display name** type `Access ms-identity-javascript-tutorial-c3s2-api`
        - For **User consent description** type `Allow the application to access ms-identity-javascript-tutorial-c3s2-api on your behalf.`
        - Keep **State** as **Enabled**
        - Click on the **Add scope** button on the bottom to save this scope.
1. On the right side menu, select the `Manifest` blade.
   - Set `accessTokenAcceptedVersion` property to **2**.
   - Click on **Save**.

#### Configure the service app to use your app registration

Open the project in your IDE (like Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code) to configure the code.

> In the steps below, "ClientID" is the same as "Application ID" or "AppId".

1. Open the `config.json` file.
1. Find the key `clientID` and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of the `ms-identity-javascript-tutorial-c3s2-api` application copied from the Azure portal.
1. Find the key `tenantID` and replace the existing value with your Azure AD tenant ID.
1. Find the key `audience` and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of the `ms-identity-javascript-tutorial-c3s2-api` application copied from the Azure portal.

#### Register the client app

1. Navigate to the Microsoft identity platform for developers [App registrations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908) page.
1. Select **New registration**.
1. In the **Register an application page** that appears, enter your application's registration information:
   - In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `ms-identity-javascript-tutorial-c3s2-spa`.
   - Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in any organizational directory or any identity provider. For authenticating users with Azure AD B2C**.
   - In the **Redirect URI (optional)** section, select **Web** in the combo-box and enter the following redirect URI: `http://localhost:6420`.
1. Select **Register** to create the application.
1. In the app's registration screen, find and note the **Application (client) ID**. You use this value in your app's configuration file(s) later in your code.
1. Select **Save** to save your changes.
1. In the app's registration screen, click on the **API Permissions** blade in the left to open the page where we add access to the APIs that your application needs.
    - Click the **Add a permission** button and then,
    - Ensure that the **My APIs** tab is selected.
    - In the list of APIs, select the API that you've just registered, i.e. `ms-identity-javascript-tutorial-c3s2-api`.
    - In the **Delegated permissions** section, select the **access_as_user** in the list. Use the search box if necessary.
    - Click on the **Add permissions** button at the bottom.
    - Finally, click on the **Grant admin consent** button at the top.

#### Configure the client app to use your app registration

Open the project in your IDE (like Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code) to configure the code.

> In the steps below, "ClientID" is the same as "Application ID" or "AppId".

Open the `App\authConfig.js` file:

1. Find the key `msalConfig.auth.clientId` and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of the `ms-identity-javascript-tutorial-c3s2-spa` application copied from the Azure portal.
1. Find the key `msalConfig.auth.redirectUri` and replace the existing value with the base address of the `ms-identity-javascript-tutorial-c3s2-spa` app (by default `http://localhost:6420`).
1. Find the key `apiConfig.scopes` and replace the existing value with the scope of your web API (e.g. `api://e767d418-b80b-4568-9754-557f40697fc5/access_as_user`).
1. Find the key `apiConfig.uri` and replace the existing value with the coordinates of your web API (by default `http://localhost:5000`).

Open the `App\policies.js` file:

1. Find the key `b2cPolicies.names` and replace it with the names (IDs) of your policies/user-flows e.g. `b2c_1_susi`.
1. Find the key `b2cPolicies.authorities` abd replace it with the authority strings of your policies/user-flows e.g. `https://fabrikamb2c.b2clogin.com/fabrikamb2c.onmicrosoft.com/b2c_1_susi`.
1. Find the key `b2cPolicies.authorityDomain` abd replace it with the domain of your authority e.g. `fabrikamb2c.b2clogin.com`.

## About the code

### Acquire a Token

**Access Token** requests in **MSAL.js** are meant to be *per-resource-per-scope(s)*. This means that an **Access Token** requested for resource **A** with scope `scp1`:

- cannot be used for accessing resource **A** with scope `scp2`, and,
- cannot be used for accessing resource **B** of any scope.

The intended recipient of an **Access Token** is represented by the `aud` claim; in case the value for the `aud` claim does not mach the resource APP ID URI, the token should be considered invalid. Likewise, the permissions that an Access Token grants is represented by the `scp` claim. See [Access Token claims](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens#payload-claims) for more information.

**MSAL.js** exposes 3 APIs for acquiring a token: `acquireTokenPopup()`, `acquireTokenRedirect()` and `acquireTokenSilent()`:

```javascript
    myMSALObj.acquireTokenPopup(request)
        .then(response => {
            // do something with response
        })
        .catch(error => {
            console.log(error)
        });
```

For `acquireTokenRedirect()`, you must register a redirect promise handler:

```javascript
    myMSALObj.handleRedirectPromise()
        .then(response => {
            // do something with response
        })
        .catch(error => {
            console.log(error);
        });

    myMSALObj.acquireTokenRedirect(request);
```

### Token Validation

[passport-azure-ad](https://github.com/AzureAD/passport-azure-ad) validates the token against the `issuer`, `scope` and `audience` claims (defined in `BearerStrategy` constructor) using the `passport.authenticate()` API:

```javascript
    app.get('/api', passport.authenticate('oauth-bearer', { session: false }),
        (req, res) => {
            console.log('Validated claims: ', req.authInfo);
    );
```

On the web API side, [passport-azure-ad](https://github.com/AzureAD/passport-azure-ad) validates the token against the `issuer`, `scope` and `audience` claims (defined in `BearerStrategy` constructor) using the `passport.authenticate()` API:

```javascript
    app.get('/api', passport.authenticate('oauth-bearer', { session: false }),
        (req, res) => {
            console.log('Validated claims: ', req.authInfo);
    );
```

Clients should treat access tokens as opaque strings, as the contents of the token are intended for the resource only (such as a web API or Microsoft Graph). For validation and debugging purposes, developers can decode **JWT**s (*JSON Web Tokens*) using a site like [jwt.ms](https://jwt.ms).

### CORS Settings

For the purpose of the sample, **cross-origin resource sharing** is enabled for **all** domains. This is insecure. In production, you should modify this as to allow only the domains that you designate.

```javascript
    app.use((req, res, next) => {
        res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*");
        res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "Authorization, Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept");
        next();
    });
```
