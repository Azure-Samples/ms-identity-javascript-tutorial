## Overview

This sample demonstrates a Vanilla JavaScript single-page application (SPA) that lets users authenticate against [Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis) (Azure AD) using the [Microsoft Authentication Library for JavaScript](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js) (MSAL.js), then acquires an **Access Token** for a protected web API for the signed-in user and calls the protected web API. In doing so, it also illustrates various authorization concepts, such as [token validation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens#validating-tokens), [CORS configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/cross-origin-resource-sharing--cors--support-for-the-azure-storage-services#understanding-cors-requests), **silent requests** and more.

## Scenario

1. The client application uses the **MSAL.js** library to sign-in a user and obtain a JWT **Access Token** from **Azure AD**.
1. The **Access Token** is used as a **bearer** token to *authorize* the user to call the protected web API.
1. The protected web API responds with the claims in the **Access Token**.

## Registration

### Register the sample application(s) with your Azure Active Directory tenant

There is one project in this sample. To register it, you can:

- either follow the steps below for manually register your apps
- or use PowerShell scripts that:
  - **automatically** creates the Azure AD applications and related objects (passwords, permissions, dependencies) for you.
  - modify the projects' configuration files.

<details>
  <summary>Expand this section if you want to use this automation:</summary>

> :warning: If you have never used **Azure AD Powershell** before, we recommend you go through the [App Creation Scripts](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md) once to ensure that your environment is prepared correctly for this step.

1. On Windows, run PowerShell and navigate to the root of the cloned directory.
1. In PowerShell run:

   ```PowerShell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process -Force
   ```

1. Run the script to create your Azure AD application and configure the code of the sample application accordingly.
1. In PowerShell run:

   ```PowerShell
   cd .\AppCreationScripts\
   .\Configure.ps1
   ```

   > Other ways of running the scripts are described in [App Creation Scripts](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md)
   > The scripts also provide a guide to automated application registration, configuration and removal which can help in your CI/CD scenarios.

</details>

Follow the steps below to manually walk through the steps to register and configure the applications in the Azure portal.

### Choose the Azure AD tenant where you want to create your applications

As a first step you'll need to:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. If your account is present in more than one Azure AD tenant, select your profile at the top right corner in the menu on top of the page, and then **switch directory** to change your portal session to the desired Azure AD tenant..

### Register the service app (msal-node-api)

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Select the **App Registrations** blade on the left, then select **New registration**.
1. In the **Register an application page** that appears, enter your application's registration information:
    1. In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `msal-node-api`.
    1. Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in this organizational directory only**
    1. Select **Register** to create the application.
1. In the **Overview** blade, find and note the **Application (client) ID**. You use this value in your app's configuration file(s) later in your code.
1. In the app's registration screen, select the **Authentication** blade to the left.
1. If you don't have a platform added, select **Add a platform** and select the **Web** option.
    1. In the **Redirect URI** section enter the following redirect URI:
        1. ``
    1. Click **Save** to save your changes.
1. In the app's registration screen, select the **Expose an API** blade to the left to open the page where you can publish the permission as an API for which client applications can obtain [access tokens](https://aka.ms/access-tokens) for. The first thing that we need to do is to declare the unique [resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow) URI that the clients will be using to obtain access tokens for this API. To declare an resource URI(Application ID URI), follow the following steps:
    1. Select **Set** next to the **Application ID URI** to generate a URI that is unique for this app.
    1. For this sample, accept the proposed Application ID URI (`api://{clientId}`) by selecting **Save**.
        > :information_source: Read more about Application ID URI at [Validation differences by supported account types (signInAudience)](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/supported-accounts-validation).

#### Publish Delegated Permissions

1. All APIs must publish a minimum of one [scope](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow#request-an-authorization-code), also called [Delegated Permission](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-permissions-and-consent#permission-types), for the client apps to obtain an access token for a *user* successfully. To publish a scope, follow these steps:
1. Select **Add a scope** button open the **Add a scope** screen and Enter the values as indicated below:
    1. For **Scope name**, use `Todolist.Read`.
    1. Select **Admins and users** options for **Who can consent?**.
    1. For **Admin consent display name** type in *Todolist.Read*.
    1. For **Admin consent description** type in *e.g. Allows the app to read the signed-in user's files.*.
    1. For **User consent display name** type in *scopeName*.
    1. For **User consent description** type in *eg. Allows the app to read your files.*.
    1. Keep **State** as **Enabled**.
    1. Select the **Add scope** button on the bottom to save this scope.
    > Repeat the steps above for another scope named **Todolist.ReadWrite**
1. Select the **Manifest** blade on the left.
    1. Set `accessTokenAcceptedVersion` property to **2**.
    1. Select on **Save**.

> :information_source:  Follow [the principle of least privilege when publishing permissions](https://learn.microsoft.com/security/zero-trust/develop/protected-api-example) for a web API.

#### Publish Application Permissions

1. All APIs should publish a minimum of one [App role for applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-add-app-roles-in-azure-ad-apps#assign-app-roles-to-applications), also called [Application Permission](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-permissions-and-consent#permission-types), for the client apps to obtain an access token as *themselves*, i.e. when they are not signing-in a user. **Application permissions** are the type of permissions that APIs should publish when they want to enable client applications to successfully authenticate as themselves and not need to sign-in users. To publish an application permission, follow these steps:
1. Still on the same app registration, select the **App roles** blade to the left.
1. Select **Create app role**:
    1. For **Display name**, enter a suitable name for your application permission, for instance **Todolist.Read.All**.
    1. For **Allowed member types**, choose **Application** to ensure other applications can be granted this permission.
    1. For **Value**, enter **Todolist.Read.All**.
    1. For **Description**, enter *e.g. Allows the app to read the signed-in user's files.*.
    1. Select **Apply** to save your changes.
    > Repeat the steps above for another app permission named **Todolist.ReadWrite.All**

#### Configure Optional Claims

1. Still on the same app registration, select the **Token configuration** blade to the left.
1. Select **Add optional claim**:
    1. Select **optional claim type**, then choose **Access**.
    1. Select the optional claim **idtyp**.
    > Indicates token type. This claim is the most accurate way for an API to determine if a token is an app token or an app+user token. This is not issued in tokens issued to users.
    1. Select the optional claim **acct**.
    > Provides user's account status in tenant. If the user is a **member** of the tenant, the value is *0*. If they're a **guest**, the value is *1*.
    1. Select **Add** to save your changes.

#### Configure the service app (msal-node-api) to use your app registration

Open the project in your IDE (like Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code) to configure the code.

> In the steps below, "ClientID" is the same as "Application ID" or "AppId".

1. Open the `API\authConfig.js` file.
1. Find the key `Enter_the_Application_Id_Here` and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of `msal-node-api` app copied from the Azure portal.
1. Find the key `Enter_the_Tenant_Info_Here` and replace the existing value with your Azure AD tenant/directory ID.

### Register the client app (msal-javascript-spa)

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Select the **App Registrations** blade on the left, then select **New registration**.
1. In the **Register an application page** that appears, enter your application's registration information:
    1. In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `msal-javascript-spa`.
    1. Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in this organizational directory only**
    1. Select **Register** to create the application.
1. In the **Overview** blade, find and note the **Application (client) ID**. You use this value in your app's configuration file(s) later in your code.
1. In the app's registration screen, select the **Authentication** blade to the left.
1. If you don't have a platform added, select **Add a platform** and select the **Single-page application** option.
    1. In the **Redirect URI** section enter the following redirect URIs:
        1. `http://localhost:3000`
        1. `http://localhost:3000/redirect`
    1. Click **Save** to save your changes.
1. Since this app signs-in users, we will now proceed to select **delegated permissions**, which is is required by apps signing-in users.
    1. In the app's registration screen, select the **API permissions** blade in the left to open the page where we add access to the APIs that your application needs:
    1. Select the **Add a permission** button and then:
    1. Ensure that the **My APIs** tab is selected.
    1. In the list of APIs, select the API `msal-node-api`.
    1. In the **Delegated permissions** section, select **Todolist.Read**, **Todolist.ReadWrite** in the list. Use the search box if necessary.
    1. Select the **Add permissions** button at the bottom.

#### Configure Optional Claims

1. Still on the same app registration, select the **Token configuration** blade to the left.
1. Select **Add optional claim**:
    1. Select the optional claim **acct**.
    > Provides user's account status in tenant. If the user is a **member** of the tenant, the value is *0*. If they're a **guest**, the value is *1*.
    1. Select **Add** to save your changes.

#### Configure the client app (msal-javascript-spa) to use your app registration

Open the project in your IDE (like Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code) to configure the code.

> In the steps below, "ClientID" is the same as "Application ID" or "AppId".

1. Open the `SPA\public\authConfig.js` file.
1. Find the key `Enter_the_Application_Id_Here` and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of `msal-javascript-spa` app copied from the Azure portal.
1. Find the key `Enter_the_Tenant_Info_Here` and replace the existing value with your Azure AD tenant/directory ID.
1. Find the key `Enter_the_Web_Api_Application_Id_Here` and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of `msal-node-api` app copied from the Azure portal.

## About the code

### Acquire a Token

**Access Token** requests in **MSAL.js** are meant to be *per-resource-per-scope(s)*. This means that an **Access Token** requested for resource **A** with scope `scp1`:

- cannot be used for accessing resource **A** with scope `scp2`, and,
- cannot be used for accessing resource **B** of any scope.

The intended recipient of an **Access Token** is represented by the `aud` claim; in case the value for the `aud` claim does not mach the resource APP ID URI, the token should be considered invalid. Likewise, the permissions that an Access Token grants is represented by the `scp` claim. See [Access Token claims](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens#payload-claims) for more information.

**MSAL.js** exposes 3 APIs for acquiring a token: `acquireTokenPopup()`, `acquireTokenRedirect()` and `acquireTokenSilent()`:

```javascript
    myMSALObj.acquireTokenPopup(request)
        .then(response => {
            // do something with response
        })
        .catch(error => {
            console.log(error)
        });
```

For `acquireTokenRedirect()`, you must register a redirect promise handler:

```javascript
    myMSALObj.handleRedirectPromise()
        .then(response => {
            // do something with response
        })
        .catch(error => {
            console.log(error);
        });

    myMSALObj.acquireTokenRedirect(request);
```

The **MSAL.js** exposes the `acquireTokenSilent()` API which is meant to retrieve non-expired token silently.

```javascript
    msalInstance.acquireTokenSilent(request)
        .then(tokenResponse => {
        // Do something with the tokenResponse
        }).catch(async (error) => {
            if (error instanceof InteractionRequiredAuthError) {
                // fallback to interaction when silent call fails
                return myMSALObj.acquireTokenPopup(request);
            }
        }).catch(error => {
            handleError(error);
        });
```

### Dynamic Scopes and Incremental Consent

In **Azure AD**, the scopes (permissions) set directly on the application registration are called static scopes. Other scopes that are only defined within the code are called dynamic scopes. This has implications on the **login** (i.e. loginPopup, loginRedirect) and **acquireToken** (i.e. `acquireTokenPopup`, `acquireTokenRedirect`, `acquireTokenSilent`) methods of **MSAL.js**. Consider:

```javascript
     const loginRequest = {
          scopes: [ "openid", "profile", "User.Read" ]
     };
     const tokenRequest = {
          scopes: [ "Mail.Read" ]
     };

     // will return an ID Token and an Access Token with scopes: "openid", "profile" and "User.Read"
     msalInstance.loginPopup(loginRequest);

     // will fail and fallback to an interactive method prompting a consent screen
     // after consent, the received token will be issued for "openid", "profile" ,"User.Read" and "Mail.Read" combined
     msalInstance.acquireTokenSilent(tokenRequest);
```

In the code snippet above, the user will be prompted for consent once they authenticate and receive an **ID Token** and an **Access Token** with scope `User.Read`. Later, if they request an **Access Token** for `User.Read`, they will not be asked for consent again (in other words, they can acquire a token *silently*). On the other hand, the user did not consented to `Mail.Read` at the authentication stage. As such, they will be asked for consent when requesting an **Access Token** for that scope. The token received will contain all the previously consented scopes, hence the term *incremental consent*.

### CORS settings

For the purpose of the sample, **cross-origin resource sharing** (CORS) is enabled for **all** domains and methods, using the Express.js cors middleware. This is insecure and only used for demonstration purposes here. In production, you should modify this as to allow only the domains that you designate. If your web API is going to be hosted on **Azure App Service**, we recommend configuring CORS on the App Service itself. This is illustrated in [app.js](./API/app.js):

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const cors = require('cors');

const app = express();

app.use(cors());
```

### Access token validation

On the web API side, [passport-azure-ad](https://github.com/AzureAD/passport-azure-ad) verifies the incoming access token's signature and validates it's payload against the `issuer` and `audience` claims (defined in `BearerStrategy` constructor) using the `passport.authenticate()` API. In the `BearerStrategy` callback, you can add further validation steps as shown below (see [app.js](./API/app.js)):

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const passport = require('passport');
const passportAzureAd = require('passport-azure-ad');

const app = express();

const bearerStrategy = new passportAzureAd.BearerStrategy({
    identityMetadata: `https://${authConfig.metadata.authority}/${authConfig.credentials.tenantID}/${authConfig.metadata.version}/${authConfig.metadata.discovery}`,
    issuer: `https://${authConfig.metadata.authority}/${authConfig.credentials.tenantID}/${authConfig.metadata.version}`,
    clientID: authConfig.credentials.clientID,
    audience: authConfig.credentials.clientID, // audience is this application
    validateIssuer: authConfig.settings.validateIssuer,
    passReqToCallback: authConfig.settings.passReqToCallback,
    loggingLevel: authConfig.settings.loggingLevel,
    loggingNoPII: authConfig.settings.loggingNoPII,
}, (req, token, done) => {
    /**
     * Access tokens that have neither the 'scp' (for delegated permissions) nor
     * 'roles' (for application permissions) claim are not to be honored.
     */
    if (!token.hasOwnProperty('scp') && !token.hasOwnProperty('roles')) {
        return done(new Error('Unauthorized'), null, "No delegated or app permission claims found");
    }

    /**
     * If needed, pass down additional user info to route using the second argument below.
     * This information will be available in the req.user object.
     */
    return done(null, {}, token);
});

app.use(passport.initialize());

passport.use(bearerStrategy);

// exposed API endpoint
app.use('/api',
    passport.authenticate('oauth-bearer', {
        session: false,
    }),
    router
);
```

For validation and debugging purposes, developers can decode **JWT**s (*JSON Web Tokens*) using [jwt.ms](https://jwt.ms).

### Verifying permission type

Web API endpoints should be prepared to accept calls from both users and applications, and should have control structures in place to respond each accordingly. This is illustrated in [permissionUtils.js](./API/auth/permissionUtils.js):

```JavaScript
const isAppOnlyToken = (accessTokenPayload) => {

     if (!accessTokenPayload.hasOwnProperty('idtyp')) {
        if (accessTokenPayload.hasOwnProperty('scp')) {
            return false;
        } else if (!accessTokenPayload.hasOwnProperty('scp') && accessTokenPayload.hasOwnProperty('roles')) {
            return true;
        }
    }

    return accessTokenPayload.idtyp === 'app';
};
```

### Access to data

Controllers should check if the presented access token has the necessary permissions to access the data, depending on the type of permission. This is illustrated in [todolist.js](./API/controllers/todolist.js):

```JavaScript
exports.getTodos = (req, res, next) => {
    if (isAppOnlyToken(req.authInfo)) {
        if (hasRequiredApplicationPermissions(req.authInfo, authConfig.protectedRoutes.todolist.applicationPermissions.read)) {
            try {
                const todos = db.get('todos')
                    .value();
    
                res.status(200).send(todos);
            } catch (error) {
                next(error);
            }
        } else {
            next(new Error('Application does not have the required permissions'))
        }
    } else {
        if (hasRequiredDelegatedPermissions(req.authInfo, authConfig.protectedRoutes.todolist.delegatedPermissions.read)) {
            try {
                const owner = req.authInfo['oid'];
    
                const todos = db.get('todos')
                    .filter({ owner: owner })
                    .value();
    
                res.status(200).send(todos);
            } catch (error) {
                next(error);
            }
        } else {
            next(new Error('User does not have the required permissions'))
        }
    }
}
```

When granting access to data based on scopes, be sure to follow [the principle of least privilege](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/secure-least-privileged-access).
