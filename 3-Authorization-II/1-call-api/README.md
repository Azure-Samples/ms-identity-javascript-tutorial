## Overview

This sample demonstrates a Vanilla JavaScript single-page application (SPA) that lets users authenticate against [Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis) (Azure AD) using the [Microsoft Authentication Library for JavaScript](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js) (MSAL.js), then acquires an **Access Token** for a protected web API for the signed-in user and calls the protected web API. In doing so, it also illustrates various authorization concepts, such as [token validation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens#validating-tokens), [CORS configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/storageservices/cross-origin-resource-sharing--cors--support-for-the-azure-storage-services#understanding-cors-requests), **silent requests** and more.

## Scenario

1. The client application uses the **MSAL.js** library to sign-in a user and obtain a JWT **Access Token** from **Azure AD**.
1. The **Access Token** is used as a **bearer** token to *authorize* the user to call the protected web API.
1. The protected web API responds with the claims in the **Access Token**.

## Registration

### Register the sample application(s) with your Azure Active Directory tenant

There is one project in this sample. To register it, you can:

- either follow the steps below for manually register your apps
- or use PowerShell scripts that:
  - **automatically** creates the Azure AD applications and related objects (passwords, permissions, dependencies) for you.
  - modify the projects' configuration files.

<details>
  <summary>Expand this section if you want to use this automation:</summary>

> :warning: If you have never used **Azure AD Powershell** before, we recommend you go through the [App Creation Scripts](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md) once to ensure that your environment is prepared correctly for this step.

1. On Windows, run PowerShell and navigate to the root of the cloned directory.
1. In PowerShell run:

   ```PowerShell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process -Force
   ```

1. Run the script to create your Azure AD application and configure the code of the sample application accordingly.
1. In PowerShell run:

   ```PowerShell
   cd .\AppCreationScripts\
   .\Configure.ps1
   ```

   > Other ways of running the scripts are described in [App Creation Scripts](./AppCreationScripts/AppCreationScripts.md)
   > The scripts also provide a guide to automated application registration, configuration and removal which can help in your CI/CD scenarios.

</details>

Follow the steps below to manually walk through the steps to register and configure the applications in the Azure portal.

### Choose the Azure AD tenant where you want to create your applications

As a first step you'll need to:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. If your account is present in more than one Azure AD tenant, select your profile at the top right corner in the menu on top of the page, and then **switch directory** to change your portal session to the desired Azure AD tenant..

### Register the service app

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select the **Azure AD** service.
1. Select the **App Registrations** blade on the left, then select **New registration**.
1. In the **Register an application page** that appears, enter your application's registration information:
   - In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `ms-identity-javascript-tutorial-c3s1-api`.
   - Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in this organizational directory only**.
1. Select **Register** to create the application.
1. In the app's registration screen, find and note the **Application (client) ID**. You use this value in your app's configuration file(s) later in your code.
1. Select **Save** to save your changes.
1. In the app's registration screen, select the **Expose an API** blade to the left to open the page where you can declare the parameters to expose this app as an Api for which client applications can obtain [access tokens](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens) for.
The first thing that we need to do is to declare the unique [resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow) URI that the clients will be using to obtain access tokens for this Api. To declare an resource URI, follow the following steps:
   - Click `Set` next to the **Application ID URI** to generate a URI that is unique for this app.
   - For this sample, accept the proposed Application ID URI (api://{clientId}) by selecting **Save**.
1. All Apis have to publish a minimum of one [scope](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow#request-an-authorization-code) for the client's to obtain an access token successfully. To publish a scope, follow the following steps:
   - Select **Add a scope** button open the **Add a scope** screen and Enter the values as indicated below:
        - For **Scope name**, use `access_as_user`.
        - Select **Admins and users** options for **Who can consent?**
        - For **Admin consent display name** type `ms-identity-javascript-c3s1-api`
        - For **Admin consent description** type `Allows the app to access ms-identity-javascript-tutorial-c3s1-api as the signed-in user.`
        - For **User consent display name** type `Access ms-identity-javascript-c3s1-api`
        - For **User consent description** type `Allow the application to access ms-identity-javascript-tutorial-c3s1-api on your behalf.`
        - Keep **State** as **Enabled**
        - Click on the **Add scope** button on the bottom to save this scope.
1. On the right side menu, select the `Manifest` blade.
   - Set `accessTokenAcceptedVersion` property to **2**.
   - Click on **Save**.

#### Configure the service app to use your app registration

Open the project in your IDE (like Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code) to configure the code.

> In the steps below, "ClientID" is the same as "Application ID" or "AppId".

1. Open the `config.json` file.
1. Find the key `clientID` and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of the `ms-identity-javascript-tutorial-c3s1-api` application copied from the Azure portal.
1. Find the key `tenantID` and replace the existing value with your Azure AD tenant ID.
1. Find the key `audience` and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of the `ms-identity-javascript-tutorial-c3s1-api` application copied from the Azure portal.

#### Register the client app

1. Navigate to the Microsoft identity platform for developers [App registrations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908) page.
1. Select **New registration**.
1. In the **Register an application page** that appears, enter your application's registration information:
   - In the **Name** section, enter a meaningful application name that will be displayed to users of the app, for example `ms-identity-javascript-c3s1-spa`.
   - Under **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in your organizational directory only**.
   - In the **Redirect URI (optional)** section, select **Single-Page Application** in the combo-box and enter the following redirect URI: `http://localhost:3000/`.
1. Select **Register** to create the application.
1. In the app's registration screen, find and note the **Application (client) ID**. You use this value in your app's configuration file(s) later in your code.
1. Select **Save** to save your changes.
1. In the app's registration screen, click on the **API Permissions** blade in the left to open the page where we add access to the APIs that your application needs.
    - Click the **Add a permission** button and then,
    - Ensure that the **My APIs** tab is selected.
    - In the list of APIs, select the API that you've just registered, i.e. `ms-identity-javascript-tutorial-c3s1-api`.
    - In the **Delegated permissions** section, select the **access_as_user** in the list. Use the search box if necessary.
    - Click on the **Add permissions** button at the bottom.

#### Configure the client app to use your app registration

Open the project in your IDE (like Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code) to configure the code.

> In the steps below, "ClientID" is the same as "Application ID" or "AppId".

Open the `App\authConfig.js` file. Then:

1. Find the key `Enter_the_Application_Id_Here` and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of the `ms-identity-javascript-c3s1-spa` application copied from the Azure portal.
1. Find the key `Enter_the_Cloud_Instance_Id_Here/Enter_the_Tenant_Info_Here` and replace the existing value with `https://login.microsoftonline.com/<your-tenant-id>`.
1. Find the key `Enter_the_Redirect_Uri_Here` and replace the existing value with the base address of the `ms-identity-javascript-tutorial-c3s1-spa` application (by default `http://localhost:3000`).
1. Find the key `Enter_the_Web_Api_Uri_Here` and replace the existing value with the coordinates of your web API (by default `http://localhost:5000/api`).
1. Find the key `Enter_the_Web_Api_Scope_Here` and replace the existing value with the scopes for your web API, like `api://e767d418-b80b-4568-9754-557f40697fc5/access_as_user`. You can copy this from the **Expose an API** blade of the web APIs registration.

## About the code

### Acquire a Token

**Access Token** requests in **MSAL.js** are meant to be *per-resource-per-scope(s)*. This means that an **Access Token** requested for resource **A** with scope `scp1`:

- cannot be used for accessing resource **A** with scope `scp2`, and,
- cannot be used for accessing resource **B** of any scope.

The intended recipient of an **Access Token** is represented by the `aud` claim; in case the value for the `aud` claim does not mach the resource APP ID URI, the token should be considered invalid. Likewise, the permissions that an Access Token grants is represented by the `scp` claim. See [Access Token claims](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens#payload-claims) for more information.

**MSAL.js** exposes 3 APIs for acquiring a token: `acquireTokenPopup()`, `acquireTokenRedirect()` and `acquireTokenSilent()`:

```javascript
    myMSALObj.acquireTokenPopup(request)
        .then(response => {
            // do something with response
        })
        .catch(error => {
            console.log(error)
        });
```

For `acquireTokenRedirect()`, you must register a redirect promise handler:

```javascript
    myMSALObj.handleRedirectPromise()
        .then(response => {
            // do something with response
        })
        .catch(error => {
            console.log(error);
        });

    myMSALObj.acquireTokenRedirect(request);
```

The **MSAL.js** exposes the `acquireTokenSilent()` API which is meant to retrieve non-expired token silently.

```javascript
    msalInstance.acquireTokenSilent(request)
        .then(tokenResponse => {
        // Do something with the tokenResponse
        }).catch(async (error) => {
            if (error instanceof InteractionRequiredAuthError) {
                // fallback to interaction when silent call fails
                return myMSALObj.acquireTokenPopup(request);
            }
        }).catch(error => {
            handleError(error);
        });
```

### Dynamic Scopes and Incremental Consent

In **Azure AD**, the scopes (permissions) set directly on the application registration are called static scopes. Other scopes that are only defined within the code are called dynamic scopes. This has implications on the **login** (i.e. loginPopup, loginRedirect) and **acquireToken** (i.e. `acquireTokenPopup`, `acquireTokenRedirect`, `acquireTokenSilent`) methods of **MSAL.js**. Consider:

```javascript
     const loginRequest = {
          scopes: [ "openid", "profile", "User.Read" ]
     };
     const tokenRequest = {
          scopes: [ "Mail.Read" ]
     };

     // will return an ID Token and an Access Token with scopes: "openid", "profile" and "User.Read"
     msalInstance.loginPopup(loginRequest);

     // will fail and fallback to an interactive method prompting a consent screen
     // after consent, the received token will be issued for "openid", "profile" ,"User.Read" and "Mail.Read" combined
     msalInstance.acquireTokenSilent(tokenRequest);
```

In the code snippet above, the user will be prompted for consent once they authenticate and receive an **ID Token** and an **Access Token** with scope `User.Read`. Later, if they request an **Access Token** for `User.Read`, they will not be asked for consent again (in other words, they can acquire a token *silently*). On the other hand, the user did not consented to `Mail.Read` at the authentication stage. As such, they will be asked for consent when requesting an **Access Token** for that scope. The token received will contain all the previously consented scopes, hence the term *incremental consent*.

### Token Validation

On the web API side, [passport-azure-ad](https://github.com/AzureAD/passport-azure-ad) validates the token against the `issuer`, `scope` and `audience` claims (defined in `BearerStrategy` constructor) using the `passport.authenticate()` API:

```javascript
    app.get('/api', passport.authenticate('oauth-bearer', { session: false }),
        (req, res) => {
            console.log('Validated claims: ', req.authInfo);
    );
```

Clients should treat access tokens as opaque strings, as the contents of the token are intended for the resource only (such as a web API or Microsoft Graph). For validation and debugging purposes, developers can decode **JWT**s (*JSON Web Tokens*) using a site like [jwt.ms](https://jwt.ms).

### CORS Settings

For the purpose of the sample, **cross-origin resource sharing** is enabled for **all** domains. This is insecure. In production, you should modify this as to allow only the domains that you designate.

```javascript
    app.use((req, res, next) => {
        res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*");
        res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "Authorization, Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept");
        next();
    });
```
