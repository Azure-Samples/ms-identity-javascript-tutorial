## Overview

This sample demonstrates a Vanilla JavaScript single-page application that lets users authenticate against [Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-whatis) (Azure AD) using the [Microsoft Authentication Library for JavaScript](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-js) (MSAL.js), then acquires an **Access Token** for Microsoft Graph and calls the [Microsoft Graph API](https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/overview). In doing so, it also illustrates various authorization concepts, such as [Access Tokens](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens), [Authorization Code Grant](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow), [Dynamic Scopes and Incremental Consent](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-permissions-and-consent), **silent requests** and more.

In addition, this sample also demonstrates how to use the [Microsoft Graph JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-javascript) client with MSAL as a custom authentication provider to query the Graph API. Note that you are not required to implement a custom provider, as the v3.0 (preview) of the SDK offers a [default provider](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-javascript/blob/dev/docs/AuthCodeMSALBrowserAuthenticationProvider.md) that implements MSAL.js.

## Scenario

1. The client application uses the **MSAL.js** to sign-in a user and obtain a JWT **Access Token** from **Azure AD**:
1. The **Access Token** is used as a *bearer* token to authorize the user to call the **Microsoft Graph API**.
1. **Microsoft Graph API** responds with the resource that the user has access to.

## Registration

### Update the client app registration (ms-identity-javascript-c1s1-spa)

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select the **Azure AD** service.
1. Select the **App Registrations** blade on the left, then find and select the application that you have registered in the previous tutorial (`ms-identity-javascript-c1s1-spa`).
1. In the app's registration screen, click on the **API permissions** blade in the left to open the page where we add access to the APIs that your application needs.
   - Click the **Add a permission** button and then,
   - Ensure that the **Microsoft APIs** tab is selected.
   - In the *Commonly used Microsoft APIs* section, click on **Microsoft Graph**
   - In the **Delegated permissions** section, select the **User.Read** in the list. Use the search box if necessary.
   - Click on the **Add permissions** button at the bottom.

### Configure the client app to use your app registration

1. Open the `App\authConfig.js` file.
1. Find the key `Enter_the_Application_Id_Here` and replace the existing value with the application ID (clientId) of the `ms-identity-javascript-c1s1` application copied from the Azure portal.
1. Find the key `Enter_the_Tenant_Info_Here` and replace the existing value with `https://login.microsoftonline.com/<your-tenant-id>`.
1. Find the key `Enter_the_Redirect_Uri_Here` and replace the existing value with the base address of the `ms-identity-javascript-c1s1` project (by default `http://localhost:3000`).

## Running the sample

Locate the sample folder, then type:

```console
    npm start
```

## Explore the sample

1. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
1. Click the **sign-in** button on the top right corner.
1. Next, click the **See my profile** button on the left. This will make a MS Graph call.
1. Click the **Read my mails** button below to see your mails.

## About the code

### Protected resources and scopes

In order to access a protected resource on behalf of a signed-in user, the app needs to present a valid **Access Token** to that resource owner (in this case, Microsoft Graph). The intended recipient of an **Access Token** is represented by the `aud` claim (in this case, it should be the Microsoft Graph API's App ID); in case the value for the `aud` claim does not mach the resource **APP ID URI**, the token should be considered invalid. Likewise, the permissions that an **Access Token** grants is represented by the `scp` claim. See [Access Token claims](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens#payload-claims) for more information.

### Dynamic scopes and incremental consent

In **Azure AD**, the scopes (permissions) set directly on the application registration are called static scopes. Other scopes that are only defined within the code are called dynamic scopes. This has implications on the **login** (i.e. loginPopup, loginRedirect) and **acquireToken** (i.e. `acquireTokenPopup`, `acquireTokenRedirect`, `acquireTokenSilent`) methods of **MSAL.js**. Consider:

```javascript
     const loginRequest = {
          scopes: [ "openid", "profile", "User.Read" ]
     };
     const tokenRequest = {
          scopes: [ "Mail.Read" ]
     };

     // will return an ID Token and an Access Token with scopes: "openid", "profile" and "User.Read"
     msalInstance.loginPopup(loginRequest);

     // will fail and fallback to an interactive method prompting a consent screen
     // after consent, the received token will be issued for "openid", "profile" ,"User.Read" and "Mail.Read" combined
     msalInstance.acquireTokenSilent(tokenRequest);
```

In the code snippet above, the user will be prompted for consent once they authenticate and receive an **ID Token** and an **Access Token** with scope `User.Read`. Later, if they request an **Access Token** for `User.Read`, they will not be asked for consent again (in other words, they can acquire a token *silently*). On the other hand, the user did not consented to `Mail.Read` at the authentication stage. As such, they will be asked for consent when requesting an **Access Token** for that scope. The token received will contain all the previously consented scopes, hence the term *incremental consent*.

### Acquire a Token

**MSAL.js** exposes 3 APIs for acquiring a token: `acquireTokenPopup()`, `acquireTokenRedirect()` and `acquireTokenSilent()`:

```javascript
    myMSALObj.acquireTokenPopup(request)
        .then(response => {
            // do something with response
        })
        .catch(error => {
            console.log(error)
        });
```

For `acquireTokenRedirect()`, you must register a redirect promise handler:

```javascript
    myMSALObj.handleRedirectPromise()
        .then(response => {
            // do something with response
        })
        .catch(error => {
            console.log(error);
        });

    myMSALObj.acquireTokenRedirect(request);
```

The **MSAL.js** exposes the `acquireTokenSilent()` API which is meant to retrieve non-expired token silently.

```javascript
    msalInstance.acquireTokenSilent(request)
        .then(tokenResponse => {
        // Do something with the tokenResponse
        }).catch(async (error) => {
            if (error instanceof InteractionRequiredAuthError) {
                // fallback to interaction when silent call fails
                return myMSALObj.acquireTokenPopup(request);
            }
        }).catch(error => {
            handleError(error);
        });
```

### Access Token validation

Clients should treat access tokens as opaque strings, as the contents of the token are intended for the **resource only** (such as a web API or Microsoft Graph). For validation and debugging purposes, developers can decode **JWT**s (*JSON Web Tokens*) using a site like [jwt.ms](https://jwt.ms).

### Calling the Microsoft Graph API

[Microsoft Graph JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-javascript) provides various utility methods to query the Graph API. While the SDK has a default authentication provider that can be used in basic scenarios, it can also be extended to use with a custom authentication provider such as MSAL. To do so, we will initialize the Graph SDK client with [clientOptions](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-javascript/blob/dev/docs/CreatingClientInstance.md) method, which contains an `authProvider` object of class **MyAuthenticationProvider** that handles the token acquisition process for the client.

```javascript
const getGraphClient = () => {
    let clientOptions = {
        authProvider: new MyAuthenticationProvider(),
    };

    const graphClient = Client.initWithMiddleware(clientOptions);

    return graphClient;
}
```

**MyAuthenticationProvider** needs to implement the [IAuthenticationProvider](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-javascript/blob/dev/src/IAuthenticationProvider.ts) interface, which can be done as shown below:

```javascript
class MyAuthenticationProvider {

    /**
     * This method will get called before every request to the ms graph server
     * This should return a Promise that resolves to an accessToken (in case of success) or rejects with error (in case of failure)
     * Basically this method will contain the implementation for getting and refreshing accessTokens
     */
    getAccessToken() {
        return new Promise(async (resolve, reject) => {
            let response;

            response = await msalInstance.acquireTokenSilent({
                account: account,
                scopes: scopes
            });

            if (response.accessToken) {
                resolve(response.accessToken);
            } else {
                reject(Error('Failed to acquire an access token'));
            }
        });
    }
}
```

See [graph.js](./App/graph.js). The Graph client then can be used as shown below:

```javascript
function readMail() {

    getGraphClient({
        account: myMSALObj.getAccountByUsername(username),
        scopes: graphConfig.graphMailEndpoint.scopes,
        interactionType: msal.InteractionType.Popup
    }).api('/me/messages').get()
        .then((response) => {
            return updateUI(response, graphConfig.graphMailEndpoint.uri);
        }).catch((error) => {
            console.log(error);
        });
}
```
